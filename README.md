#Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines -(machine learning)


Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines

In the dynamic world of finance, understanding investor sentiment is crucial for making informed investment decisions. News headlines, with their concise and informative nature, serve as a valuable source of information that can be analyzed to gauge market sentiment. In this project, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to analyze news headlines and predict stock price movements.

------------------------------------

Dataset and Problem Definition

The dataset utilized in this project comprises a combination of world news headlines and corresponding stock price shifts. Spanning from 2000 to 2016, the data was meticulously scraped from Yahoo Finance via Kaggle. The dataset features 25 columns, each representing top news headlines for a specific day. The target variable, representing the stock price movement, is categorized into two classes:

Class 1: Stock price increased

Class 0: Stock price stayed the same or decreased

-----------------------------------

Feature Extraction and Classification

To extract meaningful features from the news headlines, we employed two well-established techniques:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): This technique assigns weights to words based on their frequency within a document and their overall rarity in the corpus.

Bag of Words (BoW): This technique represents each document as a vector of word counts, ignoring the order of words.

Subsequently, we employed three machine learning algorithms to classify news headlines based on their sentiment and predict stock price movements:

Random Forest Classifier: This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees to enhance predictive performance.

Multinomial Naive Bayes: This probabilistic classifier assumes that features are independent of each other, making it well-suited for text classification tasks.

Passive Aggressive Classifier: This classifier iteratively updates its decision boundary based on misclassified examples, making it efficient for large datasets.

Evaluation and Results

To evaluate the performance of each classifier, we employed a k-fold cross-validation approach, dividing the dataset into k equal subsets. The classifier was trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process was repeated k times, providing an unbiased estimate of the classifier's generalization ability.

The results revealed that Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy, followed by Multinomial Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive Classifier. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods in capturing complex patterns in text data.

Conclusion

Stock sentiment analysis using news headlines offers a promising approach for predicting stock price movements. By leveraging machine learning techniques, investors can gain valuable insights from news headlines, enabling them to make informed investment decisions.
